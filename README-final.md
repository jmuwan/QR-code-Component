## My process
Started with html; inlcusion of the image using the <img> tag, Made the first paragraphy a heading woth the <h1> tag, and the second paragraph with <p> tag. Proceeded with CSS
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I have learned how to use semantic tags like nav, main, footer. In CSS, i have learned some properties of flexbox like align-items: center; which centers every content vertically and justify-content: center; which also centers the content horizontally. Its also my first time to use internal CSS, as i always used external CSS and then like it  into my html. 

### Continued development
For future improvemet, i will like to lear more of Javascript like the DOM manuplation, JSONs, iteractive JS, also use its frameworks like react.js, Typescript ad others(Angular).
